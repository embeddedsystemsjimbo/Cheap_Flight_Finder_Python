This app find the cheapestest available flights online using the Tequilla API, by seaching through a predetermined list of destinations stored as a Google Sheets document and accessed using the Sheety API.  If flight is found that are cheaper than the historically lowest price, the app sends an SMS message to my phone using the Twillio API.
