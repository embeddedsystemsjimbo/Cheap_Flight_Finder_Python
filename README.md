# Cheap_Flight_Finder_Python


This Python app finds the cheapest available flights online using the Tequila API. The API searches a predetermined list of destinations stored as a Google Sheets document and accesses them using the Sheety API (See Figure 1). 

If the API finds a flight that is cheaper than the historic lowest price for a certain destination, the app sends an email or an SMS message to the user via the Twillio API (See Figure 2).

Flights are selected with a minimum trip duration of seven days and a maxinum duration of thirty days.
