# Cheap_Flight_Finder_Python


This Python app find the cheapest available flights online using the Tequila API, by searching through a predetermined list of destinations stored as a Google Sheets document and accessed using the Sheety API (See Figure 1).  If a flight is found that is cheaper than the historic lowest price for a given destination, the app sends an SMS warning message to my phone using the Twillio API (See Figure 2).
